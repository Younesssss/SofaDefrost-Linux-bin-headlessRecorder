		<h1> Animation Editor </h1>
		
		<p>The "AnimationEditor" component is used to build an animation from key points motion, or typically to build effector goals trajectories.</p>
		<br>

		<br>
		<b>How to</b>
		<p> Load the animation (click left on the simulation visu window and press cltr+l). Press "Animate". 
		The "AnimationEditor" component inherites from SOFA controller. In SOFA, a controller has an input data "listening" that has to be set to true if you 			want the component to be active in your scene, "listening=1".
<br>
<br>
		Now you can build your animation. To navigate through the timeline, click left on the scene window and use the following keyboard commands:
<br>
<br>
		<b>ctrl+right arrow</b> : move the cursor to the right<br>
		<b>ctrl+left arrow</b> : move the cursor to the left

<br><br>
		The cursor is represented by a white triangle. You can now move the key points that you created with "MechanicalObject" and save a keyframe. Between 			two keyframes an interpolation is computed to create the animation. A keyframe is represented by a yellow triangle upon a line. Here are the keyframes 			commands:
<br><br>
		<b>ctrl+a</b> : add a key in the cursor location<br>
		<b>ctrl+d</b> : delete the key<br>
		<b>ctrl+c</b> : copy the key<br>
		<b>ctrl+x</b> : cut the key<br>
		<b>ctrl+v</b> : paste the key
<br><br>
		You can also save, load or play/pause the animation using the following commands:
<br><br>
		<b>ctrl+w</b> : (write) save the animation in "filename"<br>
		<b>ctrl+l</b> : load the animation from "filename". Note: can only read animation made with this component.<br>
		<b>ctrl+p</b> : play/pause the animation
<br>
